# BaseSync Project Specification

## Project Overview

BaseSync is an AI-driven system designed to revolutionize code review and documentation processes. The system will integrate with GitHub repositories to automatically monitor code changes, generate intelligent insights, and maintain living documentation that evolves with the codebase.

## Core Vision

BaseSync will serve as a bridge between code and documentation, ensuring that changes in one are reflected in the other. By leveraging AI (specifically large language models), the system will understand the intent behind code changes and provide contextual insights that go beyond traditional static analysis tools.

## Primary Objectives

1. Create a real-time monitoring system that tracks GitHub repositories, capturing pull requests and commits as they happen
2. Use AI to analyze code changes for security, performance, and maintainability implications
3. Generate human-readable summaries that explain both what changed and why it matters
4. Maintain automatically updated documentation that stays in sync with the codebase
5. Provide a conversational interface for developers to query the system about code changes

## Technical Requirements

### GitHub Integration

- Create webhook endpoints to receive repository events (pull requests, commits)
- Implement secure authorization using GitHub's HMAC verification
- Extract metadata from commits and pull requests
- Parse and analyze file diffs to understand code changes
- Post AI-generated comments directly to pull requests

### AI Analysis Engine

- Integrate with multiple LLMs (GPT-4 Turbo, Claude, Hugging Face models)
- Create a prompt engineering system to guide the AI in generating useful insights
- Implement a scoring system for security, performance, maintainability, and project alignment
- Support different levels of analysis detail (from high-level summaries to in-depth reviews)

### Data Management

- Create a database schema to store repositories, pull requests, commits, file changes, and AI-generated insights
- Implement a vector database for semantic search across code and documentation
- Design efficient data structures for storing code diffs and change history
- Ensure proper indexing for quick retrieval of historical changes

### Documentation Generation

- Create a system to automatically update documentation based on code changes
- Maintain links between code, documentation, and product requirements
- Generate documentation in multiple formats (Markdown, HTML)
- Support versioned documentation that aligns with code versions

### User Interface

- Create API endpoints for programmatic access to the system
- Implement a conversational interface for natural language queries about code
- Provide a dashboard for visualizing code changes and their impacts
- Support customizable notifications and alerts

## Unique Value Proposition

BaseSync stands apart from other code analysis tools by:

1. **Understanding Intent** - Focuses on the "why" behind code changes, not just the "what"
2. **Living Documentation** - Maintains documentation that evolves automatically with the code
3. **Contextual Analysis** - Evaluates changes in the context of the entire project and its goals
4. **Conversational Interface** - Allows natural language interaction with code knowledge
5. **Alignment Focus** - Ensures code changes align with product requirements and project vision

## Technical Challenges

### AI Integration Complexity

- Managing API rate limits and costs
- Ensuring consistent quality of AI outputs
- Optimizing prompts for specific code analysis tasks
- Handling various programming languages and paradigms

### Accurate Diff Analysis

- Parsing complex code diffs correctly
- Understanding semantic changes vs. syntactic changes
- Identifying impactful changes vs. minor modifications
- Supporting multiple programming languages

### Real-time Processing

- Handling high-volume repositories with frequent changes
- Ensuring timely analysis without overwhelming the system
- Managing webhook reliability and retry mechanisms

### Documentation Generation

- Creating documentation that reflects code accurately
- Maintaining document structure over time
- Balancing completeness with readability
- Supporting different documentation styles and formats

## Security Considerations

- Secure handling of repository access tokens
- Protection of sensitive code information
- Proper implementation of webhook verification
- Secure storage of credentials and configuration
- Regular security audits and compliance checks
- Data isolation between different repositories

## Performance Requirements

- Response time for webhook processing < 5 seconds
- AI analysis completion < 30 seconds for typical PR
- Support for repositories with up to 10,000 files
- Ability to handle up to 100 pull requests per day
